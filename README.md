# Open Maritime Risk Analysis Tool, OMRAT
This is a QGIS plugin for calculating the risk of accidents at sea, based on the Equations by Pedersen (1995) and Friis-Hansen (2008).

This plugin has been funded by Naturv√•rdsverket and RISE

The plugin is still under development and there are much coding to do before it covers all risks in the documentation.

# TODO: 
* Make it compatible with IWRAP
- Add import of IWRAP format
- Create export to IWRAP format
- Add import of geometries
- Analyse groundings and allisions for each part of the geometries
- Implement collisions

* Extend the use case
- Add some consequence modelling e.g. add how much energy that a wind turbine can withstand, how much oil each vessel have etc. and the consequence of an allision
